# EMG_SIgnal_Classification

Our project focuses on leveraging machine learning to interpret electromyographic (EMG) signals, with the ultimate goal of enhancing prosthetic limb technology.

# Introduction

In modern society, there is a growing recognition of the importance of inclusivity and equity, driving the need for advanced prosthetic devices. Central to this endeavor is the real-time classification of EMG signals, a challenging task crucial for controlling prosthetic hands.

# Challenges

The primary challenge lies in achieving high classification accuracy of EMG signals with minimal delay. Real-time interpretation of these signals is essential for ensuring precise translation of a person's intended movements.

# Approach

Our project tackles this challenge through sophisticated feature extraction techniques, which play a pivotal role in revealing discriminative information carried by EMG signals. We focus on time-domain feature extraction methods, such as waveform length, root mean square, mean absolute value, and standard deviation, chosen for their suitability in real-time systems.

# Machine Learning Algorithms

To achieve our goals, we employ state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms:

Extra Trees Classifier: This method, known for its utilization of ensemble methods, constructs "extra-trees" or "extremely randomized trees" from multiple randomized decision trees fitted on various sub-samples of the dataset.
XGBoost: An esteemed open-source library providing optimized gradient boosting algorithms within the Gradient Boosting framework.
Random Forest Classifier: A versatile algorithm known for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data, making it suitable for EMG signal classification.

# Conclusion

Through our project, we aim to contribute to the advancement of prosthetic limb technology by improving the accuracy and efficiency of EMG signal classification. By harnessing the power of machine learning, we strive to make significant strides towards creating prosthetic devices that better serve individuals with limb impairments.
